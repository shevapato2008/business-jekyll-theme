      DESCRIPTION
    </p>
    <p align="left" style="color:black;">
      Are you a MS or PhD student interested applying machine learning techniques to big-data sets? Are you excited by analyzing and modeling terabytes of text, images, and other types of data to solve real-world problems? We love data and we have lots of it. We’re looking for smart scientists capable of using machine learning and statistical techniques to invent state-of-the-art solutions to design, evangelize, and implement state-of-the-art solutions for never-before-solved problems.

Amazon has multiple positions available for Machine Learning Scientists in Seattle, Palo Alto, Boston, New York, Pittsburgh, and Cupertino, for machine learning experts that will be graduating before September 2019.
